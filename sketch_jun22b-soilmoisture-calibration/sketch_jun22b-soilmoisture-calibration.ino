// SparkFun Soil Moisture Sensor and Serial LCD example 1
// By Sarah Al-Mutlaq 2015
// Sketch reads sensor and desplays level and whether soil is wet or dry

// Use the softwareserial library to create a new "soft" serial port
// for the display. This prevents display corruption when uploading code.
// #include <SoftwareSerial.h>

// Attach the serial display's RX line to digital pin 2
// SoftwareSerial mySerial(3,2); // pin 2 = TX, pin 3 = RX (unused)


// Here we are setting up some water thersholds that we will 
// use later. Note that you will need to change these to match
// your soil type and environment.

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(9600); // set up serial port for 9600 baud (speed)

  // wet or dry based on our threshold values above.

  // We need to set up a pin to get the value that the soil 
  // moisture sensor is outputting, so sensorValue will get the

  // out thresholdDown value we set earlier, and if it is have 
  // words "Dry, Water it!" display one column over on the first 
  // row:

  // the display it had, so if our soil was really wet and drying 
  // the words would only change to "Dry, Water it!" when it got to the lower threshold
  // (thresholdDown), but if it was dry and getting wetter the words
